Top 50 AWS Interview Questions & Answers for Backend Developers
üü¢ 1. AWS Basics

### 1. What is AWS?

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform offering IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS ‚Äî providing services like EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

2. What are the main advantages of AWS?

Scalability

High Availability

Pay-as-you-go pricing

Region = Geographical area (e.g., ap-south-1).

Availability Zone (AZ) = Data centers inside a region, providing redundancy.

4. What is the Shared Responsibility Model?

AWS: Responsible for security of the cloud (hardware, network).

You: Responsible for security in the cloud (data, access, encryption).

5. What is Edge Location?

A CDN endpoint used by services like CloudFront to deliver content with low latency.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Compute Services (EC2, Lambda, Containers)

On-Demand

Reserved

Spot

Dedicated Instances/Hosts

8. What is the difference between EC2 and Lambda?

Feature	EC2	Lambda
Management	User-managed	Fully managed

9. What is Auto Scaling?

Automatically adjusts EC2 instance count based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.

10. Difference between ECS and EKS?

ECS: AWS-managed container orchestration (Docker).

EKS: Managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

11. What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

PaaS service to deploy and scale web apps (Node.js, Python, etc.) without managing infrastructure.

12. What is AWS Lambda?

A serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events (API call, file upload, etc.).

13. What is a Lambda cold start?

Delay that occurs when AWS creates a new instance of a Lambda function after being idle.

14. How do you reduce cold start time in Lambda?

Use provisioned concurrency

Keep function small

Use Node.js/Python over heavy runtimes

Warm-up triggers

15. When to use Lambda vs EC2?

Use Lambda for event-based tasks, EC2 for long-running, stateful applications.

üíæ 3. Storage & Databases
16. Difference between S3 and EBS?
Feature	S3	EBS
Storage type	Object	Block
Access	API	Attached to EC2
Use case	Backup, media	Databases, OS
17. What are S3 storage classes?

Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier, Deep Archive.

18. How to make an S3 bucket private?

Set bucket policies or block public access using IAM policies and ACLs.

19. What is RDS?

Relational Database Service ‚Äî managed service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Aurora.

20. What is DynamoDB?

A fully managed NoSQL key-value and document database with auto-scaling and high throughput.

21. Difference between RDS and DynamoDB?
Feature	RDS	DynamoDB
Type	Relational	NoSQL
Schema	Fixed	Flexible
Scaling	Manual	Automatic
22. What is Aurora?

A high-performance, MySQL/PostgreSQL-compatible relational database optimized by AWS.

23. What is ElastiCache?

In-memory caching service supporting Redis and Memcached for fast data retrieval.

24. How to handle DB connection pooling in Lambda?

Use RDS Proxy or connection pooling libraries to reuse connections efficiently.

üåê 4. Networking & Security
25. What is a VPC?

Virtual Private Cloud ‚Äî an isolated network where you can launch AWS resources securely.

26. Difference between public and private subnets?

Public subnet: Internet-accessible via IGW.

Private subnet: Restricted, accessed via NAT Gateway.

27. What is a Security Group?

A virtual firewall controlling inbound/outbound traffic for EC2 instances (stateful).

28. Difference between Security Group and NACL?
Feature	SG	NACL
Level	Instance	Subnet
Stateful	Yes	No
29. What is Route 53?

A DNS and routing service that supports failover, latency-based, and weighted routing.

30. What is CloudFront?

AWS CDN service that caches content globally for faster delivery and lower latency.

31. How to secure backend APIs in AWS?

Use API Gateway + Lambda authorizers

IAM roles & policies

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)

‚òÅÔ∏è 5. API & Serverless
32. What is API Gateway?

A fully managed service to create, publish, secure, and monitor REST or WebSocket APIs.

33. Difference between REST API and HTTP API in API Gateway?

REST API: Advanced features (usage plans, caching).

HTTP API: Cheaper and faster, fewer features.

34. How do you handle CORS in API Gateway?

Enable CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) in API Gateway settings or Lambda response.
