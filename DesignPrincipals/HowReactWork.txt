What Is React?

React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) created by Facebook for building fast, interactive user interfaces using a component-based architecture.

It follows the idea of:

“UI = f(state)”
Meaning — the UI is a function of your data (state).

🧩 1. Component-Based Architecture

React breaks the UI into independent, reusable components.

Each component:

Has its own state and props

Returns JSX (JavaScript + HTML syntax)

Can be reused anywhere

Example:

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

🔁 2. Virtual DOM (Core Concept)

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is React’s most powerful optimization.

🧠 How It Works:

React keeps a virtual copy of the DOM in memory.

When the state changes, React:

Creates a new Virtual DOM

Diffs it with the previous version (using the “diffing algorithm”)

Patches only the changed parts in the real DOM

This makes React extremely fast, because direct DOM manipulation is expensive.

💡 Example
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
  Clicked {count} times
</button>


When setCount is called:

React re-renders the component virtually

Diffs the old and new trees

Updates only the changed text node in the real DOM

✅ Efficient and smooth.

⚙️ 3. React Reconciliation (Diffing Algorithm)

React uses an O(n) diffing algorithm to detect minimal changes:

Compares element types

Updates only the modified nodes

Reuses existing components when possible

This process is called Reconciliation.

🪄 4. React Fiber (Re-rendering Engine)

React’s internal engine is called Fiber (since React 16+).

Fiber breaks rendering work into small units called “fibers,” allowing React to:

Pause, resume, and abort rendering

Maintain smooth UIs even during heavy updates

It gives React its asynchronous rendering ability.

🔄 5. State and Props Flow

Props → data passed from parent to child (read-only)

State → internal data managed inside a component

When state or props change → React re-renders the affected component tree.

🧠 6. Unidirectional Data Flow

Data in React flows in one direction:

Parent → Child


This predictable flow:

Makes debugging easier

Keeps app logic simple

Prevents inconsistent states

For complex state sharing, React uses Context API or state management libraries like Redux.

⚡ 7. JSX and Babel

React uses JSX syntax:

const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;


JSX is not HTML — it’s syntactic sugar for:

const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello World');


The Babel compiler converts JSX into JavaScript before execution.

🧱 8. ReactDOM and Rendering

React uses ReactDOM to render components into the actual browser DOM.

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);

🔀 9. Hooks (Functional React)

Modern React uses Hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useContext) to manage:

State

Lifecycle events

Side effects

Example:

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}

🧩 10. Re-Rendering Flow Summary

Here’s how React works step-by-step:

Initial render

JSX → Virtual DOM → Real DOM

State changes

Component re-renders (virtually)

Diffing

Compare old vs. new Virtual DOM

Reconciliation

Apply minimal real DOM updates

Commit phase

Browser reflects the new UI

🚀 Summary
Concept	Description
Component-based	UI broken into independent reusable pieces
Virtual DOM	React updates only what changes
Reconciliation	Efficient diffing algorithm
Fiber	Asynchronous rendering engine
Unidirectional Data Flow	Predictable state management
Hooks	Handle state and lifecycle in function components
